# Phack Man

## Plot
The **INV4D-312** is a transport spaceship that was just intercepted by an alien race classified as the **Zenytp-3D3**. Take control of **Phack Man** in his mission to clear all the floors of the cargo bay from these little bastards.

## Gameplay
Phack Man's gameplay resembles the good olâ€™ Pacman mechanics. The map is a generated maze and entities can move freely through it. Phack Man can shoot with Lock & Stock, his loyal twin miniguns.

## Map
The map is a generated maze with progressive size depending on the floor. The algorithm used is undefined by now, but some ideas arise:

* Use a classic algorithm to create a maze, or even a lib that does this for us.
* Generate small pieces and mirror them horizontally and/or vertically.

We can think of the map like a node graph where nodes are placed at maze positions where the player can turn 90 degrees.

```
# # # # # # # #
# o         o #     # - solid block
# # # # # #   #     o - map node
# o     o #   #
# # # #   #   #
# o     o   o #
# # # # # # # #
```

## Input
Straight and simple: **arrows** for **movement** and **space** to **shoot** with Lock&Stock. The player always advance if its facing allows it. This is, the player cannot be stopped in the middle of a path. The player can always turn 180 degrees and interrupt the movement from one node to other.

The event generated by the player pressing an arrow key is saved if the movement is not possible, so that this event can be used when the player reaches a node.

## Enemy behaviors

There will be defined a few behaviors, but probably **only one will be implemented** (the easiest) for time economy reasons.

1. **Boring Walker**. Wanders the maze randomly with no meaning of life.  
2. **Curious Chaser**. Wanders the maze randomly until the distance to the player is less than a threshold distance. Then it chases the player until the threshold distance is surpassed.
3. **Speedy**. Wanders the maze chasing the player. Movement is quick from node to node, but there is a resting time in each node.
4. **Insatiable Chaser**. Wanders the maze chasing the player independently from the distance to it.
5. **Unpleasant Snitch**. Wanders the maze randomly and if it detects the player in its range of vision, chases it. Each snitch also notifies other snitches about the player position. This could be improved by notifying boring walkers too.

## Possible upgrades

These upgrades won't probably be implemented, but they will be kept here for the record.

* **Lock&Stock mods**. These mods can change the rate, speed, or damage of L&S shoots.
* **Weaknesses and resistances** so that a certain mod can be strong against certain type of enemies and weak against others.
* **Vary enemy colors** to determine its toughness or Weakness&Resistances.
